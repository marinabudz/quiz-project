// createContext() function essentially creates two components.
// The FirebaseContext.Provider component is used to provide a
// Firebase instance once at the top-level of your React component tree,
// and the FirebaseContext.Consumer component is used to retrieve the Firebase instance
// if it is needed in the React component. For a well-encapsulated Firebase module,
//  weâ€™ll define a index.js file in our Firebase folder that exports all necessary functionalities
//  (Firebase class, Firebase context for Consumer and Provider components):
